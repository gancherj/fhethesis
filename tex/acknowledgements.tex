 \chapter*{Acknowledgements}
 I owe many thanks to my advisor, Adam Groce, for all of the invaluable academic guidance and advice he has given me over the past year. I would like to also thank Jim Fix and Jerry Shurman for the insights they have given me during my time at Reed.

 I would like to thank my friends and colleagues, who have supported me throughout the thesis process. Among others, I'd like to acknowledge Haley, Philip, Hannah, Orla, Max, and Sarah for their \emph{distinguished} compatriotism.

 I would \textbf{not} like to thank Mick, who did nothing but distract me with sophistry and crises of form throughout the whole ordeal.

 Finally, I thank my parents, Susan and Stephen Gancher, without whom none of this would have been possible.
